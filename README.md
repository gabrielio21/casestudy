As of 2019 Data Gumbo partnered with the OCC consortium as their main Blockchain data analyst, who’s composed of government agencies from around the world and also huge G&O companies like Shell, Exxonmobil,Chevron and more.                                
 
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 
Data Gumbo provides data and contract clarity, which gives their partners and customers easier and safer ways to work with each other without having to have a middle man(usually a lawyer) to approve contract details or agreements. 
​
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) 
Data Gumbo’s engineers set out to build a complete solution that unifies operational source data together with an industrial-grade blockchain solution. The result is GumboNet, a massively interconnected industrial blockchain network that delivers transactional certainty to business relationships. Today, Data Gumbo is an award-winning software company with successful customers around the world.

​
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? The metrics in this industry are mostly measured by the companies success and ability to provide what they stand for, also in my opinion it can be measured by the companies involved and or money made/invested in them.
​
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? 
​Compared to other Competitors DataGumbo has been in the space for longer and it has become the main go to data provider for big companies and even government organizations. 
​
## Recommendations
​
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 
From my perspective the company could use machine learning technology. By using Machine Learning they could provide a better way to create smart contracts to their subscribers. What I believe is Data Gumbo could have the machine understand the pros and cons in the subscribers industries and help contracts adapt to the changes in the industries. This way it gives the company more security and clarity in future transactions in real time within its competitors or partners. It could also determine future market crashes and market volatility.    If I was to add to the company's services, personally I would use Machine Learning technology. This machine learning technology could start by gathering data from previous contracts in the company's specific field of work, for example in Data Gumbo they provide most of their services in the Oil and Gas field. This machine could start gathering better and more accurate ways to create more accurate and clear smart contracts. By having the machine understand previous contracts it could help companies save time and work in future contracts by providing more security and accuracy in the specific field of work. So if the company's market will have a collapse coming soon it could automatically create a contract that benefits both and or multiple parties in a fair way. Basically the machine helps companies adapt to market value whether that be in an uprising market or crashing market. 
​
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? 
This product/idea will give the company a stronger pillar in their network of technologies and help the companies that work with them safe time and money on future contracts and projects.  By adapting this technology to create their smart contracts Data Gumbo could create a faster and more efficient way of having their subscribers be ahead of the curve in future market laws. 
​
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 
The main technology for this idea would be Machine Learning. This technology could provide them with better time management and become more efficient.  
​
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? 
By adding Machine Learning, their services could be more accurate in future contracts to their subscribers. Contracts are a very time consuming task and it creates conflict between parties that might not trust each other or even create uncertainty in future endeavors.
